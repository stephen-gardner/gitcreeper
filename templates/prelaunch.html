    Your last commit to the project

    For now, this is a warning, but starting on
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{.LaunchDate}}</span>,
    your project will be marked as "finished" if you fail to make commits to the master branch at least once every
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        {{.DaysUntilStagnant}} days
    </span>
    (and push it to Vogsphere). Projects closed in this fashion will have
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        {{.DaysToCorrect}} days
    </span>
    to be corrected before the score is finalized.
